        <h3>By Anup Vishwas</h3>
      She never said goodbye.  
      Not with words, at least.  
      Her silence was louder than any scream, and her absence — heavier than any goodbye ever spoken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aarav still kept her last letter tucked inside his wallet. It was creased, faded, and smelled faintly of lavender — her favorite.  
      It wasn’t a love letter. It was a list of things she wanted to do with him:  
      “Watch the sunrise from a mountain. Dance in the rain. Grow old together.”  
      She had written it on a napkin during their first coffee date.
    </p>

    <p>
      She passed away in a car accident three years ago.  
      Aarav never moved on. He didn’t want to.  
      Every morning, he made coffee for two. Every night, he whispered stories to the empty side of the bed.  
      And every year, on her birthday, he mailed a letter to her old address — knowing it would never be read.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love, he realized, wasn’t about presence.  
      It was about memory.  
      About the way her laughter still echoed in his mind.  
      About the way her dreams became his purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the day he died, the letter was still in his wallet.  
      The nurse who found it wept.  
      And someone — maybe fate, maybe love — placed a single lavender flower on his grave.
    </p>

    <p><em>Because some love stories never end. They just live quietly, in hearts that never stop remembering.</em></p>
